# 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe with Linked List in Java

A command-line implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using a **singly linked list** instead of traditional arrays or matrices. Built entirely in Java, this project showcases custom data structure usage and fundamental game logic.

## 🎯 Features

- Custom `LinkedList` structure used to represent the 3x3 game board  
- Dynamic node manipulation for game updates  
- Input validation and turn-based gameplay  
- Win condition and draw detection  
- Resettable board logic (ready for enhancements)  
- Clean object-oriented design

## 📂 Structure

TicTacToe.java      // Main game logic and flow  
LinkedList.java     // Custom linked list game board  
Node.java           // Basic node for linked list structure

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/JderenthalCS/Tic-Tac-Toe-LinkedList.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-LinkedList

2. Compile the project:
   javac *.java

3. Run the game:
   java TicTacToe

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Custom data structures (Singly Linked List)  
- Recursion-free win condition checking  
- Console-based UI logic

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- GUI version with JavaFX or Swing  
- Score tracking and reset menu  
- Multiplayer over network  
- AI opponent (minimax)
